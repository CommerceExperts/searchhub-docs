System Integration
==================

At the moment search|hub is only available as a service.

Normally all components of a big web application system are connected by http. 
A typical setup could be a load-balancer in front of a caching proxy in front of a shop system which uses a search engine over it's restful api.
search|hub is designed to become an additional component in this "chain".

In the best case it should be placed in front of the cache and only receive search traffic from the load-balancer. Such a setup provides the following advantages:

1. search|hub will improve cache hit ratio when the `SmartQuery`_ module kicks in
2. search|hub won't get unnecessary http traffic that would be passed trough anyway
3. search|hub becomes a less critical component, when only partial traffic is routed trough it
