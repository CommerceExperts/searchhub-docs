Module: SmartQuery
==================

SmartQuery is a search|hub module that maps similar queries (e.g. "skate board", "skate boarding", "skateboards", "skateboard") to the best [1]_ query - the so-called MasterQuery.
The SmartQuery module automatically connects to the search|hub API to get the required data and to send back statistics and performance information about the module itself and the mapping process.

We recommend following the `best practices`_ to get started with the SmartQuery integration into your system.



.. [1] There are also use cases, where we have ambiguous mappings that lead to several MasterQueries. They will get a special handling in the future. The best query means the best in terms of user interaction and economic outcome.
