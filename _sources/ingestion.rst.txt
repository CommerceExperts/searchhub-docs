Ingestion
=========

This section describes the different data formats we use and how you can send them to us.


Transmission possibilities
--------------------------

We provide the following possibilities to ingest the data:

- In case you're using Google-Analytics, we can use API access to fetch the necessary data

- Data exports can be pulled from some URL. Alternatively we can provide an secured FTP account, where such export files can be uploaded. 
  
- If no analytics system is available, we can also ingest log files or other raw files and extract the necessary data from it.
  This option might be charged extra however. Please contact us, to discuss this option or talk about other options.

  
  
Search Analytics Data
---------------------

Most important for search|hub are user generated search queries (user queries) and their corresponding KPIs. We recommend to use at least some of the following KPIs:

- Search-Frequency (Required!)
- Match-Count
- Unique Clicks per Query or CTR
- Clicks to Basket
- Revenue per Search
- Total-Revenue
- Exit-Rate

Based on such KPIs, search|hub will be able to make better decisions. The chosen KPIs depend on the wished goal of your search. If the zero-match rate should be lowered, the match count should be part of the analytics export.


Data format for analytics export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- An analytics export must clearly be assigned to a single tenant / shop / sales channel

- We recommend the export file(s) to be named in this format: 
  ``<custom-prefix>.<tenant>.<date:YYYY-MM-DD>[-<date:YYYY-MM-DD>].<file-extension>``

  Some explanation to the listed parts: 

  - A custom prefix or other custom strings can be part of the filename, e.g. "export..."

  - The tenant must be part of the file name! See the `glossary`_ about what a `tenant`_ is.
    
  - Each export should be associated with a certain time-range, which could be a single day or a range of two days (both considered inclusive).

    If the export only belongs to a single day, the second date is not necessary.
    
    As an exception Google-Analytics BigQuery exports are accepted to contain the associated time range as an attribute at the file content.

  The delimiters and the order of these parts are arranged, it's important to gain these listed information from it.


Whitelisted Queries
-------------------

If you have curated landing pages for certain queries or optimized search results, you can export the according queries and search|hub will prefer these queries and automaticlly increase the traffic to them.
This can be a simple txt file with the name of the tenant, e.g. ``curated-queries.<tenant>.txt`` or any other format where that information can be extracted easily.
