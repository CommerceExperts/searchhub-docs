Ingestion
=========

search|hub primarily depends on search-analytics data but also uses other kinds of data to improve the outcome:

- list of curated queries / whitelisted queries
- product data

See below what to consider when creating the according data feeds.

  
Search Analytics Data
---------------------

We provide the following possibilities to ingest analytics data:

- In case you're using Google-Analytics, we prefer to use API access to fetch the necessary data.

- File exports are also acceptable. We can pull them from some URL or provide a secured FTP account, where such export files can be uploaded.
  
- If no analytics system is available, we can also ingest log files or other raw files and extract the necessary data from it.
  This option might be charged extra, however. Please contact us, to discuss this option or talk about other options.


Google Analytics API Access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If possible, we prefer API access to your Google Analytics site-search analytics view. To do so, please grant access to the following two accounts:

    searchhub@searchhub-analytics.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    analytics@commerce-experts.com
    
Contact us afterward and let us know about the granted access, so we can set up the according to processes on our end.


Analytics File Export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case you can't give us API access to your analytics system, a file export is also acceptable. For long term usage, please make sure to provide these files regularly.

Content
"""""""
Most important for search|hub are user generated search queries (user queries) and their corresponding KPIs. We recommend using at least some of the following KPIs:

- Search-Frequency (Required!)
- Match-Count
- Unique Clicks per Query or CTR
- Clicks to Basket
- Revenue per Search
- Total-Revenue
- Exit-Rate

Based on such KPIs, search|hub will be able to make better decisions. The chosen KPIs depend on the wished goal of your search. If for example the zero-match rate should be lowered, the match count should be part of the analytics export.

Data Format
"""""""""""
As a data format, we prefer a CSV/TSV feed that meets the following conditions:

- The export must clearly be assigned to a single tenant / shop / sales channel

- We recommend the export file(s) to be named in this format: 
  ``<custom-prefix>.<tenant>.<date:YYYY-MM-DD>[-<date:YYYY-MM-DD>].<file-extension>``

  Some explanation to the listed parts: 

  - A custom prefix or other custom strings can be part of the filename, e.g. "export"

  - The tenant must be part of the file name! See the `glossary`_ about what a `tenant`_ is.m You can use your own designation, it just must be unique.
    
  - Each export should be associated with a certain date-range, which could be a single day or a range of two days (both considered inclusive).

    If the export only belongs to a single day, the second date is not necessary.
    
    As an exception, Google-Analytics BigQuery exports are accepted to contain the associated time range as an attribute at the file content.

The delimiters and the order of this information is not that important. It's just important to gain this listed information from the filename.


Whitelisted Queries
-------------------

If you have curated landing pages for certain queries or optimized search results, you can export the according to queries and search|hub will prefer these queries and automatically increase the traffic to them.
This can be a simple txt file with the name of the tenant, e.g. ``curated-queries.<tenant>.txt`` or any other format where that information can be extracted easily.


Product Data
------------

Product data should be provided as CSV / TSV file containing all kind of language data, like:

- title
- product type
- descriptions
- categories
- brand

optionally we can also use:

- attributes
- image urls
- product url


**Please talk to us, if you have other data formats / structures / feeds and no possibility to transform them into the appropriate format.**
