Getting Started
---------------

Before integrating one of our modules into your system, we need some data:

We need at least a search analytics report (e.g. an export from Google Analytics) from an representative time interval. Alternatively we also accept search logs that contain user queries and some user interaction logs (which product was clicked, put into basket etc.), which we use to generate the data on our own.

Checkout the `Ingestion`_ section for more details about the supported data formats and data access possibilities.

Based on this data, we will train search|hub and may also estimate the potential performance of search|hub. Then we will send you more information about which modules are best suitable and how they can be integrated into your system.

Please `contact us`_ to talk about your use-cases, ask us more detailed question or request a potential report.


Modules
-------

There are several approaches of "search query optimization". Each is realized as a module for search|hub and also documented separately. It's possible to combine the modules to improve each aspect of query optimization.

It is also possible to integrate the single modules directly into a system using native Java Code. Read the according module documentation for more details.


Sample User Story
-------------------

When developing according to agile principles a product owner might find it helpful to have a sample user story. Feel free to copy and paste this to your backlog

- Story: "As a searching user I want to see search results that are optimized using CXP Search|Hub (https://commerceexperts.github.io/searchhub-docs/index.html) and are frequently updated by recent kpi data."

- Acceptance criteria:
  - Search phrases are checked/optimized using Search|Hub's SmartQuery Module (https://commerceexperts.github.io/searchhub-docs/module_smartquery.html) before submitting them to the internal search engine
  - internal systems can access https://query.searchhub.io/ to perform the search phrase check
  - internal systems can access https://import.searchhub.io/ to send and receive data updates
