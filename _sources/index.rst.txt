CXP search|hub documentation
============================

search|hub automatically optimizes user generated search queries (user queries) before they hit the actual search engine as (search query). 
It therfore acts as a simple http proxy, that provides a simple plug-in system for query rewriting modules.


Getting Started
---------------

Before integrating search|hub or one of the modules into your system, we typically estimate the potential effect of search|hub. To generate such a report, we need access or an export of your web analytics system (e.g. Google-Analytics) of an representative time interval. Alternatively we also accept search logs that contain user queries and optimally some KPIs (e.g. raw tracking logs).
Based on this data, we can pre-train search|hub and estimate the potential performance of search|hub.

Please `contact us`_ to request a potential report for your data. Also check the `Ingestion`_ section concerning the data format requirements.
