Module: SmartSuggest
====================

SmartSuggest uses the enriched and clustered search|hub data to build a sophisticated suggest functionality. 
As a base technology Apache Lucene is used to provide fast and weighted query suggestions. The implementation is part of the "`Open Commerce Search Stack`_"

The module automatically connects to the search|hub API in order to get the required data and to send back statistics and performance information about the module and its usage.

We recommend following the `sample user story`_ to get started with the SmartSuggest integration into your system.
