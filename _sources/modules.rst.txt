Modules
=======

There are several approaches of "search query optimization". Each is realized as a module for search|hub, like the main module `SmartQuery`_.

By default search|hub combines the installed modules in a meaningful combination to provide the wished behavior.

It is also possible to integrate the single modules directly into a system using native Java Code, therefor read the according module documentation, especially the according integration section.
