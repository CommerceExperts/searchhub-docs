REST Service Integration
========================

In case you can't use the Java library directly (most likely because your system doesn't run on the JVM), you can use the REST-service wrapper for SmartSuggest. It's delivered as a docker image and can run in your environment. (SaaS is also an option, please contact us for more details).

Requirements
------------

- a minimum of 250MB + more space depending on the amount of data it has to manage
- the service needs to access the HTTPS Endpoints https://query.searchhub.io/ and https://import.searchhub.io/


Start the service
-----------------

The service is provided as docker image on `docker hub`_ with the name :code:`commerceexperts/searchhub-smartsuggest-service:0.7.1`
    
The container has to be started with your API key set at the environment variable `SH_API_KEY`. 
It exposes port 8081 that can be mapped to any port.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    # use the API key you'll receive from us
    docker run -d --name=smartsuggest-service -e SH_API_KEY=<YourS3cr3tAPIkey> -P commerceexperts/searchhub-smartsuggest-service:1.1

    
Use the service
---------------

The service offers two possible endpoints. Both requests are mostly identical and just differ at the version part of the request path. 
The first endpoint (v1) will return a sophisticated blockwise response and the second (v2) will return a simple list of strings. We recommend using v2 because it already cares about picking the optimal set of queries.

Keep in mind, that SmartSuggest starts fetching the necessary data, after the first request for a tenant was received. So the first few seconds all requests will return an empty result. A few seconds later you should get mapped queries (if data is available).
It's possible to lower that startup latency by specifying the tenants using the preloadTenants parameter (SH_INIT_TENANTS), which is described below.

V1 Request
^^^^^^^^^^


.. code-block:: bash

  http://<host>:<port>/smartsuggest/v1/<tenant-name>/<tenant-channel>?userQuery=<user-query>

**Response**:

.. code-block:: json

  [
    {
      "name": "best matches",
      "suggestions": [
        "suggestion 1",
        "suggestion 2",
        "etc."
      ]
    }
  ]

A block with the name "best matches" is the best case scenario. There are also 3 other kind of blocks, named "typo matches", "fuzzy matches with 1 edit" and "fuzzy matches with 2 edits". In case nothing is found, an empty array is returned.
It is also possible (depending on settings and user input) that several blocks are delivered. In such a case it's up to the implementor to decide which queries to use for the autosuggestion.
If there is no need for some special logic, we recommend to use API v2.


V2 Request
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

  http://<host>:<port>/smartsuggest/v2/<tenant-name>/<tenant-channel>?userQuery=<user-query>

**Response**:

The response is a JSON array with simple strings that can be used as autocompletion result.

.. code-block:: json

  [
    "suggestion 1",
    "suggestion 2",
    "etc."
  ]


Both kinds of requests support a "limit" parameter. Per default, the limit is set to 10. This parameter will limit the amount of returned suggestions.


Configuration
-------------

Multiple usages of `JAVA_OPTS` should be combined to a single declaration with all desired properties joined by space, for example

.. code-block:: bash

  -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dapikey='your-api-key' -Dsuggester_max_idle_minutes=90"

API KEY
^^^^^^^

The SearchHub API key can either be set using an environment variable or system property.

.. code-block:: bash

  SH_API_KEY="your-secret-api-key"
  # or
  JAVA_OPTS='-Dapikey="your-secret-api-key"'

For legacy support (to use the same naming as SmartQuery) the environment variable 'SQ_API_KEY' works as well.


Preload Tenants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specify tenants that should be loaded immediately after initialization.
Can be set via environment variable as a comma-separated list:

.. code-block:: bash

	SH_INIT_TENANTS="example.num1,example.num2"

For legacy support or to get a better and more explicit naming, this variable can also be named 'SUGGEST_INIT_TENANTS' or 'SQ_INIT_TENANTS'. All those names work in the same way.


Idle Unload
^^^^^^^^^^^

The service might unload a index when it is not used for a certain time (30 minutes by default). When a new request comes in for that tenant, the suggest index will be recreated again, but it needs some time. 
That idle timeout can be changed by passing the idle time in minutes using the following property:

.. code-block:: bash

  JAVA_OPTS="-Dsuggester_max_idle_minutes=90"



Monitoring
----------

There are several metrics that are exposed in the prometheus format through the :code:`/prometheus` endpoint of the service. This endpoint exposes a "status_up 1.0" metrics plus the metrics described in the `monitoring`_ section at the `direct integration`_ docs (in the prometheus format, which practically means underscores instead of dots).


Trouble Shooting
----------------

  - If you forgot to specify the API key, the container will stop with the log message
    `"IllegalArgumentException: no SearchHub API key provided! Either specify ENV var 'SH_API_KEY' or system property 'searchhub.apikey'"`
  - In case you tried to access an unpermitted tenant/channel (maybe because you specified the wrong API key), you will see such a message in the logs of the service: 
    `Unauthorized while fetching data for tenant 'foo.bar': [401 Unauthorized]`
  - To get more information about the internal processes, enable debug log. Do that with the docker startup parameter :code:`-e JAVA_OPTS="-Dlog.searchhub.level=DEBUG"` or for more debug messages additionally :code:`-Dlog.root.level=DEBUG`.
