Sample User Story
=================

When developing according to agile principles a product owner might find it helpful to have a sample user story. Feel free to copy and paste this to your backlog

Story
  As a customer I want to see search results that are optimized using CXP search|hub (https://commerceexperts.github.io/searchhub-docs/index.html) and are frequently updated by recent kpi data."

Acceptance criteria
  - Search phrases are checked/optimized using Search|Hub's SmartQuery Module (https://commerceexperts.github.io/searchhub-docs/module_smartquery.html) before submitting them to the internal search engine
  - internal systems can access https://query.searchhub.io/ to perform the search phrase check
  - internal systems can access https://import.searchhub.io/ to send and receive data updates
