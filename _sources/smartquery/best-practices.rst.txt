Best Practices
==============

We expressed our recommended best practices as user stories, so when developing according to agile principles a product owner might find it helpful to have a sample user story. Feel free to copy and paste this to your backlog.

Basic SmartQuery Implementation
-------------------------------

Story
  As a customer, I want to see search results that are optimized using CXP search|hub (https://commerceexperts.github.io/searchhub-docs/index.html) and are frequently updated by recent KPI data.

Acceptance criteria
  - Search phrases are checked/optimized using Search|Hub's SmartQuery Module (https://commerceexperts.github.io/searchhub-docs/module_smartquery.html) before submitting them to the internal search engine
  - internal systems can access https://query.searchhub.io/ to perform the search phrase check
  - internal systems can access https://import.searchhub.io/ to send and receive data updates


Query Correction Feedback
-------------------------

Story
  As a customer, I want to see the corrected query and have the opportunity to search for my inserted query instead.

Acceptance criteria
  - If a mapping took place, display a text about the corrected query
  - Add a link that enables the user to search for the original query instead. 
  - When clicking that link, no mapping takes place.

Technical hint
  - You can use the `bypass`_ feature of SmartQuery by wrapping the query into quotes. Passing that query will not do any mapping but remove the quotes again.
  - In case the `direct integration`_ is used, the util function `io.searchhub.smartquery.util.QueryAssessment.isOnlyWordReorder` can be used to avoid displaying the query correction feedback due to the fact, that the query consists of the same words.


Search|Hub Redirects
--------------------

Story
  As a search manager, I want users to be redirected to landing pages for certain queries according to my configuration in Search|Hub.

Acceptance criteria
  - The usage of queries, that are configured for a redirect, should lead to the configured landing page / URL.
