Best Practices
=================

In order to aid Product Owners in developing according to agile principles, we have expressed our recommended best practices as user stories. Feel free to copy and paste this to your backlog.

Basic SmartSuggest Implementation
-------------------------------

Story
  As a customer I want to see autocompletion / search suggestions in the searchbar that are optimized using CXP search|hub.

Acceptance criteria
  - When typing into the search box, search phrases are suggested based on every single typed user input using search|hub's SmartSuggest Module (https://docs.searchhub.io/module_smartsuggest.html).
  - Selecting one of those suggested queries, causes a search request to the shop
  - (In case `SmartQuery`_ is used, these suggested terms should still be mapped by SmartQuery)
  - internal systems can access https://query.searchhub.io/ to fetch the necessary data
  - internal systems can access https://import.searchhub.io/ to send usage information that are used to monitor and optimize the results


Search|Hub AI-Suggestions
-------------------------

Story
  As a user, I want to see auto-completion/search suggestions displayed when I click on the search box, even if I haven’t started typing anything yet.

Acceptance criteria
  - AI-Suggestions from search|hub are displayed when the search box is clicked on and its value is empty
  - The AI-Suggestions displayed are the most relevant for our use case, which may be a combination of different types
  - The AI-Suggestions can be displayed as a single list or in blocks, depending on the specific use case. (optimize for demand, for trends, for findability, for sellability, or a combination of all)

Technical hint
  To request the AI-Suggestions from SmartSuggest you’ll have to provide one of the following 5 different exposed **special queries** to the API:

  - MOST_INSPIRING
  - MOST_POPULAR
  - HIGHEST_POPULARITY_UPLIFT
  - HIGHEST_FINDABILITY_UPLIFT
  - HIGHEST_SELLABILITY_UPLIFT
